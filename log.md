# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and cleaned up my HTML on my Profile Page for Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS and boot strap.  I need to go back and review hw to use Twitter bootsrap.  I also need to clean up more of my classes and html.  It will probably take another hour to clean everything up.

### Day 1: January 20th, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the quote generator for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS again, but I was able to get the Javascript to work.  I am going to play around with the CSS tomorrow to see what looks good and what works.  I am also going to make a second version of this site that uses JSON instead of the quotes stored locally on the site.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
