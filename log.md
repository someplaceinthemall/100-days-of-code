# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and cleaned up my HTML on my Profile Page for Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS and boot strap.  I need to go back and review hw to use Twitter bootsrap.  I also need to clean up more of my classes and html.  It will probably take another hour to clean everything up.

### Day 1: January 21st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the quote generator for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS again, but I was able to get the Javascript to work.  I am going to play around with the CSS tomorrow to see what looks good and what works.  I am also going to make a second version of this site that uses JSON instead of the quotes stored locally on the site.

### Day 2: January 24th, 2017

Today's Progress: I was able to get a "Tweet" button to work for my quote generator

Thoughts: It was surprisingly easy to get the Twitter button working on my quote generator.  Tomorrow I am going to stuff it full of quotes and post it online for people to review.  I'm also going to fork the code and create a second version that uses JSON to practice JSON.  I struggled today cleaning up my Code School page.  I forgot how I was able to use Twitter bootstrap to get it to work when I initially created it.  Tomorrow I need to review Twitter boot strap.  I'm also going to practice HTML5 with my code school subscription for an hour.  I need to make up for 2 days from when my internet was down.

### Day 3: January 25th, 2017

Today's Progress: I used my Code School account and finished the Front End Level 2 course

Thoughts: In this tutorial, you change the way that content is displayed with CSS.  Specifically, it focused on mainly the box model.  I didn't struggle too much on this, but it was very helpful in learning how to set up web pages without using Twitter Bootstrap.

### Day 4: January 26th, 2017

Today's Progress: I used my Code School account and worked on learning more about Javascript Objects

Thoughts: This was really helpful for me to understand objects in Javascript better.  I still struggle to 100% understand OOP, and I have a lot of work left to do.
